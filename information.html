                <h2 class="font-fredoka uppercase"><i class="fas fa-subway"></i> Public transport</h2>
                <p class="information-paragraph">The Netherlands has excellent public transport links, and the swipecard payment system OV-chipkaart is the official transport payment system for the metro, bus, train and tram throughout the Netherlands.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">When you arrive at Schiphol we recommend to buy an anonymous OV-chipkaart directly and store some money on it. This is because not all places in the Netherlands accept credit cards and so the areas to charge your card are limited for travellers.
                    Also be aware that you need a minimum of €20.- or more on your card in order to travel by train. For all other ways of transportation you need a minimum of €0,01 to travel. After use, your balance can go into a negative number and
                    you'll have to charge your card more than the negative amount in order to use it again.</p><br>

                <h2 class="font-fredoka uppercase"><i class="fas fa-car"></i> Car rental</h2>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Renting a car itself is afordable and could be pretty handy but unless you are not planning to stay within the city we strongly disadvise.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Driving within Amsterdam is very confusing and dangerous because of all the bicycles that sometime come out of unexpected roads. Not only that, parking is difficult, it is hard to find a parking spot and the prices are pretty high where
                    a cheap hourly pay is around €7,50.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">It could be handy if you will be traveling to a place outside of the city for one day. Even though the public transportation system is pretty good in the Netherlands depending on your own preference you could choose to take the car.</p><br>

                <h2 class="font-fredoka uppercase"><i class="far fa-credit-card"></i> ATM & Currency</h2>
                <p class="information-paragraph">The Euro will be your main currency in the Netherlands. Paying with Euros is the most cost effective and other currencies are unlikely to be accepted.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Major credit cards and debit cards, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express are widely accepted in the Netherlands at restaurants, hotels, and tourist destinations. Although some small shops may charge a fee of anywhere from 2-6%
                    if you use them. If you only have a credit card, be advised that Dutch supermarkets do not accept them at all, so you’ll need some cash on hand for sure.</p><br>

                <p class="information-paragraph">The dutch are very open and hospitable in general. So don't be afraid to ask something, they are always very friendly and helpfull.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Do note that they are very direct and tell you immediately if something is wrong or if they do not like something. But don't worry they are not angry at you, just very honest! Therefore it is not only okay to treat them the same way, they
                    will actually appreciate it a lot if you do.</p><br>

                <h2 class="font-fredoka uppercase"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Pickpocket</h2>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Pickpockets have been known to target tourists on trams, buses and ferries in Amsterdam, taking advantage of the crowded situations and the fact that people are often distracted by their journey planning. So be extra vigilant while travelling
                    by public transport. In fact, don't put anything in your back pocket.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Here are some easy tips which will make sure you won't be a target for pickpocketing. 1. Carry only what you need. 2. Be careful with cash. 3. Thief-proof your bag. 4. No phones at the table. 5. Don’t leave your bag unattended. 6. Always
                    be vigilant. 7. Stay alert on public transport. 8. Don’t leave your wallet in your back pocket. If you did become a victim report the incident to the nearest police (politie) officer or a municipal enforcement official as soon as you
                    can.</p><br>

                <h2 class="font-fredoka uppercase"><i class="fas fa-cannabis"></i> Drugs</h2>
                <p class="information-paragraph">Amsterdam is well known for drugs in praticular marijuana. We strongly disadvise to use any kind of drugs and also don't drink too much alcohol on your stay.</p>
                <p class="information-paragraph">If you decide to try marijuana or hash we advise to always have 1 sober person with you. When you are looking for a place to buy, always go to a coffeeshop which are located everywhere in the city and never buy from random people off the
                    street, they are very likely to rip you off. Smoking marijuana is allowed on the street and even inside coffeeshops if you don't add any tobacco in the joint. The best thing is to ask beforehand so you won't get into any kind of trouble.
                    Any other drugs are strongly disadvised and also illegal.</p><br>
